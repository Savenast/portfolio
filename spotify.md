- **Streams Over Time:** Line chart showing historical streaming trends, capturing the growth of Spotify’s music library and popularity.
- **Most Streamed Artists and Songs:** Bar charts on the right display the top-streamed artists and tracks, making it easy to compare popularity at a glance.
- **Track and Stream Breakdown by Month:** A data table on the left highlights monthly streaming volume and track count, giving viewers insight into streaming patterns over the year.

**Styling Choices:** The color scheme was inspired by Spotify’s branding, with green and black elements to keep the look cohesive and on-brand.

- **Executives or Marketers:** who need a snapshot of Spotify trends without in-depth interaction or filtering.
